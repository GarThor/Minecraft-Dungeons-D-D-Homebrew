## Instructions:
"document.md" contains all of the rules, but is an autogenerated file.  If you make edits to that file it will get blown away the next time the autogeneration script is run.  Instead, please make the modifications to the general files, and then run "generate-document.py" using python 3.8.  This will regenerate "document.md" based on the source content.
