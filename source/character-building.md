# Character Building <a id="character_building" name="CharacterBuilding"></a>

Insert short introduction to character building here

## Player Characters

Minecraft itself has no race or class boundaries, and therefore any race or class accents are purely flavor.  A dragonborn barbarian will have the exact same stats as a human cleric.  All minecraft Player Characters are proficient in all Melee/Ranged weapons and Artifacts.  Since they are heroic, they start with a D10 hit die.  Core attributes may be rolled, and/or point-bought depending on Player and Dungeon Master preference.

## Non Player Characters

Non player characters include the Minecraft Villagers, and a few monsters (Mobs) within the minecraft world which have sentience (Illagers, Evokers, Enchanters, etc.)  They will be detailed in the "Monsters" section.
